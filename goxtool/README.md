Goxtool is a trading client for the MtGox Bitcon currency exchange. It is
designed to work in the Linux console (it has a curses user interface). It
can display live streaming market data and you can buy and sell with
keyboard commands.

Goxtool also has a simple interface to plug in your own automated trading
strategies, your own code can be (re)loded at runtime, it will receive
events from the API and can act upon them.
